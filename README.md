This is the development of the Simple Satellite Surrogate which is a useful stand in for real satellite systems. It emulates satellite sub systems in code and allow you to build more and more complex systems while using hardware IO to increase testing functionality and interface with other devices.


Current Status: Developing Code Base in Python to Ideally Transfer to a Raspberry Pi
